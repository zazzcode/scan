## Current work

**Component refactor, 2026-11-06:** SQL, NoSQL, standalone validation, XSS and outbound observations
are implemented and offline-verified in the assigned `analysis-pack-mvp` worktree/branch. Outbound
started from clean `dc309cd`, preserving runtime `4e0be3e` and XSS migration `30fada9`. Read the
[component ledger](../architecture/analysis-packs.md#outbound-observation-verification-2026-11-06)
for ownership, protocols, source/report parity and remaining limits. Fresh reports use schema4;
schemas1–4 remain readable with historical answers intact.

[Outbound session03](../specifications/components-03-outbound.md) selects scoped observations.
JS/TS shapes remain unverified; Python retains its demonstrated URL-operand contract. Requested
outbound assessments return explicit `not_run` with zero model calls, stay Review and leave a
requested scan incomplete. Preview rejects them without a request body. Browser requests do not
establish server SSRF. Logging migration and complete SSRF/exfiltration/browser-security assessment
remain future work.

The user assigned full offline Juice Shop E2E validation, fixes if needed, then feature commit/push.
The [full E2E ledger](../architecture/analysis-packs.md#juice-shop-full-e2e-follow-up-2026-11-06)
records actual all-registration scope, unchanged non-outbound requests and conservative incomplete
assessment behavior. Resume the existing feature worktree and preserve unrelated changes.
No paid calls, target execution, sample edits, new agents/worktrees, PR creation or integration merge
are authorized by this checkpoint. Human review remains pending.

**Completed foundation:** the [common entry/dispatch brief](../project/common-entry-dispatch.md)
records the implemented shared model with bounded dynamic-route, GraphQL resolver and gRPC
handler support, accepted and merged through PR #8. The shared model and existing HTTP/browser
consumers are migrated through
[deliverable2](../specifications/common-entry-dispatch-02-consumers-compatibility.md). Fresh
reports now use schema4 with canonical entry/context associations and component provenance; saved
schemas1–4 still export.
Typed selectors/presenters and bounded DOM/window events are implemented. Additional framework
adapters remain separately scoped work.
Use the current reviewed Python/terminology revision as the prerequisite, not the old pre-rename API.

**Architecture/terminology closeout:** embedded documents are **Analysis Guidelines**
(`internal/guidelines`); shared records live in `internal/analysis` as `CandidateUse`,
`AnalysisReport` and `RouteInventory`. `--analyze` is canonical; `--strings` remains an external
alias. Fresh analysis JSON is schema4 with `analysis_guidelines`; schema1–4 saved reports still
export. See the [implemented architecture](../architecture.md) and the
[closeout contract](../specifications/python-support.md#architecture-and-terminology-closeout).
Historical reports retain their original versions/answers; changed guideline inputs need fresh judgments.


**Prior Python activity, 2026-11-01: `python-support-base`.** The bounded Python adapter is implemented
and tested on three pinned apps. Read the [Python contract](../specifications/python-support.md),
[results and limits](../evaluation/python-support-results.md), and [user guide](../../docs/python-support.md)
for resumption. Raw results remain under `_test-findings/<app>/run-<id>/`; source keys, hashes and curated
reports are in root `docs/samples/`. 184 Luna calls were completed; saved answers require exact
request matching and changed evidence cannot inherit them. The user authorized pushing `python-support-base` and continued general hardening;
The user subsequently authorized committing/pushing this closeout and creating a draft PR into
`stage`. Integration pushes and merge remain unauthorized. Python NoSQL is out of corpus/unimplemented. Shared trace/report hardening and policy-backed
validation are documented in [trace judgment](../architecture/trace-judgment.md); all 29 independent
Python case checks pass. Only final Protected records are green.
Living answer guides for ThreatByte, the FastAPI app and the added VulnPy corpus are linked from
[Python results](../evaluation/python-support-results.md). VulnPy has six known positive coverage misses
and four warning controls; its offline baseline is not part of the original 29-case pass claim.

**Previous XSS worktree: `xss-response`.** The first XSS discovery/reporting pass was
committed and pushed as `26f50d0`. Verify the actual path, branch and changes with `pwd` and
`git status --short --branch`; later work may have advanced the branch.

For a later JS/TS XSS hardening session, read in this order:

1. [Implementation results](../evaluation/xss-implementation-results.md) for delivered behavior,
   current sample counts, actual model observations and verification limits.
2. The local, gitignored XSS handoff (`.zazz/ephemeral/xss-analysis-handoff.md`), if present, for prioritized
   investigations, code entry points and the suggested first bounded task. Handoffs MUST stay under
   `.zazz/ephemeral/` and MUST NOT be committed. A fresh clone will not contain them; resume from
   the tracked results, contract and reference documents instead.
3. [XSS contract](../specifications/xss-response.md), [scope](../project/xss-detection-scope.md),
   [product analysis guide](../../docs/analysis/xss.md) and the target's independent source-reviewed
   answer key linked from [sample reference policy](../../docs/samples/reference-policy.md).

**Current capability:** bounded JS/TS/CommonJS route and browser-source analysis, server/template/stored
and DOM/framework XSS facts, existing validation/database/outbound/logging analyzers, optional
versioned model judgments, and shared JSON/HTML/SARIF classification. Browser entries have a separate
report section. HTML can hide Protected records. This is not whole-program soundness or proven
scanner parity. Cross-tier origin, helper/control-flow and protection completeness remain hardening
work; unsupported paths stay Review. The [results](../evaluation/xss-implementation-results.md) own
current details; historical reports may contain superseded protection labels.

**Historical XSS hardening boundaries:** the earlier `xss-response` work supplied the accepted
source semantics. Current component work uses the assigned feature tree above; new detector
hardening still needs its own bounded contract. Preserve all implemented analyzers and compare
against independent source references.
Baseline vulnerable apps MUST remain unchanged; remediation uses copies. Five approved Luna calls
are complete and saved for offline inspection/replay. They authorize no additional paid requests.
Changed evidence MUST NOT reuse old model answers. The bounded Python adapter is now documented above; remaining vulnerability types follow, then SCA
for JS/TS and Python; language expansion has no fixed position in the roadmap;
shared graph/judgment/report facts remain language-neutral. No merge or integration push is authorized.

**Sample applications are read-only scan targets.** Zazzles detects vulnerabilities; agents do not
fix them in the sample apps. Agents MUST NOT edit, fix, reformat, install dependencies into, check out
another revision of, or write any file inside the pinned sample checkouts under `<DEV_ROOT>` (for
example `<DEV_ROOT>/nodejs-goof`, `<DEV_ROOT>/juice-shop`, `<DEV_ROOT>/vulnerable-typescript-app`).
Hardening changes belong in the scanner, never in a target to make a result appear. Code changes to an
application are allowed only in an independent copy created to test whether a scan detects the
remediation, following [remediation copies](../../docs/samples/reference-policy.md#remediate-a-copy).
Scan output goes to `<DEV_ROOT>/zazzcode/zazzles/_test-findings/<app>/run-<id>/` via `--output-dir`,
never into the target. Before and after a session, `git -C <target> status --porcelain --ignored` MUST
be empty and `HEAD` MUST match the pinned revision. If a checkout was changed, stop and re-clone it
from upstream at the pinned revision before trusting any further result.

The long-term objective is source-backed vulnerability and protection analysis across languages,
with accuracy evaluated independently of model confidence or scanner agreement. Independent Findings
Review remains distinct from the semantic judge. See the [project objectives](../project.md#long-term-objectives)
and [graph design](../architecture/repository-graph.md).

Earlier logger-leak, route-string and SQL/NoSQL session notes describe historical work. Their old
“next slice” instructions are not the active assignment. Consult the tracked
[route/string contract](../specifications/route-string-validation.md),
[original Bearer evaluation](../evaluation/bearer-results.md), and
[Juice Shop evaluation index](../evaluation/juice-shop/README.md) only when the current case needs them.

## Portable workspace and DEV_ROOT

**`<DEV_ROOT>` means this computer's development directory**, usually `Dev/` under the user's home.
It is documentation notation, not an implemented environment variable. Usual locations:

- Repositories: `<DEV_ROOT>/<account>/<project>`; zazzles's container is `<DEV_ROOT>/zazzcode/zazzles`.
- Reference clones: `<DEV_ROOT>/juice-shop` (application), `<DEV_ROOT>/bearer`, and `<DEV_ROOT>/codeql`
  (SAST design references).

Resolve/verify roots each session; durable docs/configuration MUST NOT hardcode usernames or absolute
checkout prefixes. Other documents should link here for workspace conventions.

## Branches and worktrees

Scan uses a shared bare Git directory with sibling worktrees. `stage` integrates work and `main` is
release-only. Use the assigned feature worktree for related design, implementation, and tests.
Independent future deliverables may use separate feature worktrees and PRs into `stage`.
Load [worktree setup](worktree-setup.md) for the layout, reference-clone handling, naming, creation,
and recovery details; [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#branch-model) declares the current `stage/` exception.

## Task reading paths

After `AGENTS.md` and this orientation, choose the smallest applicable row. Load linked sections first;
load whole design documents only when the task crosses their boundaries. A link is not an include.

| Task / question | Read next | Load more when |
|---|---|---|
| Run scan or confirm route extraction | [README](../../README.md#run), [verification and limits](../project/06-route-validation-assessment.md#route-verification) | Read the [route spec](../specifications/tree-sitter-route-identification-mvp.md) and `internal/parse` when changing the route contract |
| Plan this branch's input-validation work | [near-term sequence](../project/implementation-plan.md#route-string-validation-delivery-sequence), [assessment](../project/06-route-validation-assessment.md#architecture-and-plan-assessment) | Read architecture §§3–7 for resolution, value/guard semantics, or evidence schema changes |
| Design graph or outbound service analysis | [Repository graph design](../architecture/repository-graph.md) | Load architecture §§4–7 for shared IR, flow and evidence policy |
| Design model assessment / review | [current provider decision](../architecture.md#current-provider-decision), architecture §8, [API setup](openai-decisions-setup.md) | Read historical [Jev research](../project/04-jev-validation-research.md) only for evaluation ideas or a provider comparison |
| Set up a key or diagnose access | [API setup](openai-decisions-setup.md) | Follow its official API links for current schema/access; never load or print secrets |
| Author the next specification | Near-term plan, [spec index](../specifications/README.md), `spec-builder`, [spec hygiene](../standards/spec-hygiene.md) | Resolve only decisions required by that contract; the old route spec does not authorize this branch's implementation |
| Implement or resume | Current authorized spec, its local run log, [execution discipline](agent-execution-discipline.md), `spec-driven` | Select relevant standards from the standards index; explicit user implementation requests are sufficient authorization under AGENTS.md |
| Reassess scope or long-term architecture | Project overview, architecture, scope, then proposal | Load functionality for capability details; prior-art/research docs for evidence behind a disputed choice |

## Product documentation versus SDLC documentation

Root `docs/` owns public philosophy, user/contributor setup, CLI operation, result interpretation,
and [scan analysis rules and guidelines](../../docs/analysis/README.md). These are product documents
used by people running scans and agents refining detection. They MUST NOT be placed under `.zazz/`.
Load the [database injection](../../docs/analysis/database-injection.md),
[input validation](../../docs/analysis/input-validation.md), and
[calibration](../../docs/analysis/calibration.md) guides when changing those analyses.

`.zazz/` owns SDLC/process standards, project plans, implementation contracts, internal architecture,
and evaluation history. `.zazz/ephemeral/` is ignored execution scratch and session handoff only.
Public rules describe the implemented analysis; current Markdown files are not dynamically loaded
by the binary. Changes MUST keep those rules, Go evidence/judgment code, and tests aligned.

## Documentation map

Select the document that owns the topic; do not load every row. Research/design context is preserved

## Working protocol

Load [Agent Execution Discipline](agent-execution-discipline.md) for execution, testing, verification,
resumption, or handoff; [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) supplies repo-specific overrides. For planning,
use the [phase-slicing guide](../project/implementation-plan.md#how-a-phase-becomes-agent-manageable-work).

## Methodology refinement

The Project Owner may assign Zazz refinements during definition. Load the
[methodology](zazz-methodology.md) for that work; record whether a change is local or proposed upstream
and preserve human authority. Assigned process changes do not authorize scanner implementation.

## Commands and credentials

Commands and contributor checks: [README](../../README.md#contributing). Current live-model setup:
[OpenAI Decisions setup](openai-decisions-setup.md). Offline extraction and fixture work need no key.
The decision-model key is already configured in the local ignored `.env`; agents MUST NOT print it.
The scanner does not auto-load that file; see the [README](../../README.md#required-decision-model-setup).
API setup is separate from permission to transmit target source or execute a paid evaluation.
Live requests remain restricted to OpenAI Decisions with `gpt-6-luna`, small explicit request caps,
and no provider/model fallback. The previously reported $10 funding is context, not a spending authorization.
