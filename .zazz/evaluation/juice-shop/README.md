# Juice Shop documented challenges and Bearer review

Pinned target: v20.3.0, `f189f521266f42c6bd05884468292000cee852ed`.
All **116 documented challenges** are indexed from `data/static/challenges.yml`, including category,
description, difficulty, disabled environments and source/test references in
[expected-challenges.jsonl](expected-challenges.jsonl). Every key has a non-registry source reference.
This is the complete challenge registry at that revision, **not** a complete list of expected SAST
findings: several challenges require business intent, runtime state, dependencies or non-code clues.
Independent human labels and per-challenge SAST detectability remain pending. Source annotations and
tests are useful evidence; a challenge observer alone is not proof of exploitation or persistence.

[The comparison](../bearer-results.md) records both target scans and the original/additional controls.
[The full Bearer ledger](bearer-review.jsonl) preserves all 671 findings with source hashes, rule,
location, scope, exact documented vulnerable-line overlap where present, and review status.
Automatic reference/line matches are navigation aids, not correctness decisions.
[Summary counts](inventory-summary.json) and [explicit review decisions](review-decisions.json) are
versioned separately from the ignored raw reports.

## External exercise report

[Corisco pentest summary](coriscope-pentest-summary.md) summarizes all eleven categories in the
user-selected 2024 report, preserves attributed scores/CWE IDs, and maps comparison candidates to
our pinned inventory. Its claims are external evaluation evidence, not automatic scanner verdicts.
SQL/NoSQL judgment against known-positive, protected, and unknown cases takes priority over logger-leak.

## Initial source review

| Rule and location | Source-inspected disposition | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| logger_leak, lib/startup/validateConfig.ts:45 | False positive for sensitive-data leak | Constant public documentation URL passed through a color formatter |
| logger_leak, lib/startup/validateConfig.ts:47 | False positive for sensitive-data leak | Constant configuration-error message passed through a color formatter |
| hardcoded_secret, lib/insecurity.ts:52 | False positive for secret classification | JWT verifier receives public verification material from jwt.pub; the separate hardcoded private key remains a real concern |
| sql_injection, routes/login.ts:34 | Supported potential | Request email directly interpolates into SQL text |
| sql_injection, routes/search.ts:23 | Supported potential | Request criteria interpolates after length restriction, which does not prevent SQL syntax |
| SSRF and HTTP URL, routes/profileImageUrlUpload.ts:24 | Supported potential; one grouped concern | Request URL reaches fetch; authenticated-user requirement does not constrain destination |

These seven raw finding decisions contain three false positives and four supported potential rule
results (three grouped source/sink concerns). They are agent source inspections, not independent
human review or runtime confirmation. The other **664 findings remain pending**, so 3/671 is a lower
bound on observed false findings, not an estimated false-positive rate. Two protected custom-validator
controls also produced Bearer SQL false positives outside this application inventory.

Scope is separately recorded: 329 application/support findings, 278 test findings and 64 training
snippet findings. Test and training findings are not automatically false positives. They also must
not inflate production vulnerability counts. Caller/guard/library context is needed before dismissing
other findings; dynamic logs, YAML loading, file paths and JWT policies remain review candidates.

## Reproduce the inventory

Requires Python 3 and Ruby's standard-library YAML parser; no target code is executed.
The script checks the exact target revision and rejects tracked source modifications.

```bash
python3 .zazz/evaluation/inventory-juice-shop.py \
  --target <DEV_ROOT>/juice-shop \
  --bearer-report .zazz/ephemeral/bearer-comparison/final/bearer-juice-shop.json \
  --output .zazz/evaluation/juice-shop
```

The inventory below is generated navigation for every registry entry; maintained metadata and
references live in JSONL. No unreviewed row asserts a scanner miss or a protected route.
