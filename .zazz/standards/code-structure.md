# Code Structure

Structure rules for authored Go source and for the durable documents and skills in this repo. Applies
to `cmd/`, `internal/`, `.zazz/`, and `.agents/skills/`.

## 1. Package layout

```text
cmd/scan/          CLI entry point
internal/walk/     repository traversal and file job production
internal/parse/    Tree-sitter grammar registry and parsing worker pool
internal/graph/    node/edge types, structural resolver, graph construction
internal/rules/    source/sink query sets and classification (embedded .scm files)
internal/trace/    path search, pruning, deduplication
internal/context/  token-bounded bundle construction
internal/llm/      OpenAI-compatible broker client
internal/report/   JSON and Markdown emitters
```

Rules:

- Everything lives under `internal/` until there is a demonstrated external consumer. Do not create
  `pkg/` speculatively.
- `cmd/` packages contain only argument handling, dependency wiring, and exit codes. If `main` needs
  branching logic longer than a line or two, that logic belongs in `internal/`.
- A package owns one concern. If describing a package needs the word "and", split it.
- Dependencies point inward toward `internal/graph`. `walk` and `parse` know nothing about rules,
  tracing, or the LLM. `trace` knows nothing about Tree-sitter.
- Import cycles are a design error. Fix the boundary rather than hiding it behind an interface.
- Interfaces are declared by the consumer, not the producer, and stay small — one or two methods.
  Define an interface when there is a second real implementation (for example, a stubbed broker in
  tests), not in anticipation of one.

## 2. File size thresholds

Thresholds are guidance for when to act, not hard limits:

- **Go source file:** 400 lines is comfortable; 700 lines means split now.
- **Single function:** 60 lines is comfortable; 100 lines means extract.
- **Document (`docs/`, `standards/`, `specifications/`):** 300 lines is comfortable; 500 lines means
  split by concern.
- **`SKILL.md`:** keep the always-loaded body under 200 lines; push detail into `references/`.

A file that exceeds a threshold for a real reason (a generated table, a golden fixture) is fine — say
so in a comment so the next reader does not try to split it.

## 3. Contextual splitting

Split by **concern**, not by line count. A split is good when each resulting file can be read and
understood on its own:

- one pipeline stage per file group inside `internal/parse`, `internal/trace`, and so on
- one standard per concern in `.zazz/standards/`
- one deliverable per specification directory in `.zazz/specifications/`

Do not create `part1.go` / `part2.go`. Do not split a cohesive type across files just to hit a number.
Prefer moving a function to the package that actually owns its concern over splitting within a file.

## 4. Anti-slop rules

- No dead code, no commented-out blocks, no unused exported symbols "for later".
- No speculative abstraction: no interface, option struct, or generic type without a present caller.
- No duplicated logic. If two rules or two stages need the same walk, extract it once.
- No placeholder files. A file that exists but does nothing is worse than no file.
- Every exported identifier in `internal/` is exported only because another package in the same module
  needs it. `internal/` is not a public API.

## 5. Compute once

Parsing and graph construction dominate runtime; do not redo either.

- Parse each file exactly once per run. Cache the syntax tree for the lifetime of the file's job, and
  the extracted nodes/edges after that.
- Build the adjacency index once in stage 5 and reuse it for every source.
- Never re-read a file to recover a snippet. Carry the snippet on the node.
- Treat the compiled query set per language as process-wide state, compiled at registration.
- When a value is derived from the graph (reachability, guard status, sink category), compute it once
  and store it on the node or path rather than recomputing per query.

## 6. Determinism

Graph output must be reproducible for identical input, independent of goroutine scheduling:

- never iterate a Go map when producing ordered output — sort keys explicitly first
- never let worker completion order determine slice order; sort or index by a stable key
- no wall-clock time, random seed, or host-specific value in graph or findings output
- when parallelism is added to a stage, assert the same output as the sequential version in a test

Determinism is a correctness requirement here, not a nicety: the LLM stage and the JSON report both
depend on a stable graph.

## 7. Comment and naming discipline

- Exported identifiers get doc comments starting with the identifier name.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. A comment restating the code is noise.
- Do not cite specifications, task IDs, or PR numbers in source comments — those live in the
  specification and the PR, not in code that outlives them.
