# 02 — Proposed project scope

**Concept stage, 2026-10-19.** Scope and quality targets remain subject to refinement. This document,
the [architecture](../architecture.md), and the [phased plan](implementation-plan.md) are inputs to
future specifications; none is permission to implement.

## Objective

Establish whether a Go + Tree-sitter + bounded dataflow + Jev scanner can produce useful, reviewable
findings for selected OWASP-related source-code risks at acceptable cost. Prove a small JS/TS slice
before committing to broad language or vulnerability coverage.

## Current work

Current repository state lives in the [project overview](../project.md#concept-stage-repository-state).
The [orientation](../docs/scan-agent-orientation.md#current-work) defines the active documentation
session and routes to its operating rules.

## Proposed initial scope

- Local CLI operation over explicitly selected source trees.
- JS/TS extraction and supported import/call resolution.
- Named rules for a small set of input-to-sink risks and deterministic patterns.
- Local CFG/dataflow followed by bounded resolved argument/return propagation.
- Guard-use and branch context sufficient to distinguish validation from mere validator presence.
- Traceable string candidates and evidence bundles; experiments with Jev validation/sanitization
  assessment, followed by an LLM Findings Reviewer for identified issues and uncertain candidates.
- Explicit unknown/uncertain/unexamined outcomes and coverage accounting.
- JSON/Markdown output, stable identity, reviewable baselines, and measured CI policy.
- Dependency-aware caching after correctness is established.

## Proposed later scope

- Python, then Go and Java adapters with language-specific analysis semantics.
- Additional frameworks, rule families, optional sensitive-data impact tags, and SARIF.
- Explicit bounded scope checks for authorization/logic risks (the former Track C idea).

These require separate scope review, corpus evidence, and approved specs. There is no fixed promise
that all target languages or tracks are in the first release.

## Exclusions and limits

- Exhaustive whole-program analysis or a general solver for arbitrary aliases, reflection, dynamic
  dispatch, heap mutation, stored/second-order flows, or all asynchronous behavior.
- Execution of the target, runtime instrumentation, exploit attempts, or dynamic testing.
- Dependency vulnerability scanning and full secrets scanning.
- Generated patches, unrestricted LLM review, model-driven graph traversal, and unsupported generated claims.
- Hosted multi-tenant service, database-backed execution engine, or external tracking integration.
- A claim that clean output certifies security or covers every risk in an OWASP edition.

Some excluded constructs occur inside otherwise supported programs. Report them as limitations;
do not silently treat them as absent dataflow or expand scope without a contract change.

## Delivery gates

Delivery follows the [Zazz lifecycle](../docs/zazz-methodology.md#specification-driven-delivery-cycle).
The [implementation plan](implementation-plan.md) supplies dependencies and future spec slices;
phase-specific acceptance criteria must become bounded, human-greenlit contracts before execution.

## Non-functional hypotheses

| Concern | Proposed target / required decision | Evidence before commitment |
|---|---|---|
| Correctness | Separate structural facts, approximations, predictions, and gaps | Labeled safe/vulnerable pairs and unsupported-construct fixtures |
| Determinism | Stable graphs, candidates, and rule output for fixed inputs/versions | Serial/parallel and repeated-run comparisons |
| Jev and reviewer quality | Identify validation/sanitization gaps with evidence-backed findings review | Human labels, held-out cases, diagnostic baselines, false-safe/errors, reviewer disagreement and completeness |
| Latency | Suitable for developer/CI use; exact budgets unset | Hardware/fixture-defined cold/warm timings and per-request p50/p95 |
| Cost | Bounded requests and run spend; exact ceiling unset | Candidate/question counts, usage, rate-limit behavior, measured billing basis |
| Resources | Bounded workers, traversal, source retention, and payload size | Peak RSS, cancellation/backpressure, adversarial large inputs |
| Local-only mode | Deterministic operation with zero external requests | No-key/offline end-to-end evidence |
| Source handling | Send only enabled, necessary evidence to Jev and the configured LLM Findings Reviewer | Payload inspection, logging/redaction tests, owner decision on allowed transmission to each provider |
| Portability | Predictable supported binaries/platforms | Binding/cgo/build matrix; static linking is a goal to assess, not a guarantee |
| Rescans | Cached and uncached outputs agree | Dependency and model/question/rule/policy version invalidation tests |

The old low-single-digit-second parse target, 250 ms Jev claims, fractional-cent claims, and full
multi-language release scope are not established requirements. Numeric acceptance thresholds must be
selected in the relevant future spec before evaluating its results.

## Principal risks

- **Semantic gap:** syntax extraction alone does not provide CFG/dataflow. Language lowering and
  library models are substantial engineering work.
- **Flow precision:** guards on another branch, ignored returns, reassignment, aliases, and unknown
  calls can invalidate a superficially convincing path.
- **Path growth:** bounded analysis can miss candidates; limits must remain visible.
- **Classifier fitness:** typed output can still be wrong or influenced by source comments. Evaluate
  custom validation and adversarial examples, not just obvious vulnerable snippets.
- **Evidence quality:** missing dependencies can look like missing validation; low confidence does not
  have a single cause.
- **Cache overreach:** a validator judged adequate in one context is not globally safe elsewhere.
- **Coverage inflation:** “OWASP Top 10” branding can outpace tested rules and frameworks.
- **Release complexity:** native parsing, platform support, and multiple adapters can dominate scope.

## Decision tracking

The [proposal register](03-jev-design-proposal.md#open-decision-register) owns open decisions and their
refinement gates. Update that register when scope or evidence changes rather than keeping a second
question list here.
