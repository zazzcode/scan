# Route evidence bundles and claim assessment

**Design and bounded implementation, 2026-10-31.** This owns how target source becomes judge evidence
and claim-scoped results. [Repository graph design](repository-graph.md) owns the full graph; the
[current contract](../specifications/route-string-validation.md) owns implemented scope and acceptance.

## Product objective

Present findings in terms of **inbound route → middleware/handlers → input definitions and
transformations → sensitive use**. A use may be a database query, account creation, an outbound API
request, or a later supported sink. Relevant response continuations form separate value relationships.
The product evaluates sufficient validation and sink-specific protection, then proposes complementary
improvements with source evidence. The long-term direction is selected OWASP Top 10 families plus
[dependency auditing](sca-design.md). No route is certified impervious to every attack.

## Evidence selection

Supply a bounded source-backed graph slice **and** the actual code of its relevant functions. A graph
alone omits custom-validator semantics; the entire repository forces the judge to rediscover paths
and buries evidence. Go selects and substantiates supported relationships. GPT Decisions or Jev
interprets adequacy for a precise declared requirement. A model MUST NOT invent missing edges.

The current checked mode accepts a JSON requirements file via `--checks`. It declares method/path,
fields, operation kind, validation requirement and protection requirement without an expected answer.
The phase's [two-case file](../evaluation/juice-shop/validation-checks.json) reflects the user's stated
requirements for the pinned target; the scanner does not hard-code those paths, helper names, or an
acceptable validator regex. Domain requirements are explicit policy inputs, not guessed from missing
validators or TypeScript annotations.

A bundle includes:

- Method/path and source-backed registration/receiver/handler references.
- Applicable earlier USE registrations and same-route middleware in registration order.
- Request-field dependencies, supported local transfers, and the actual sensitive operand.
- Relevant local/named/namespace helper definitions, including pre-use calls without return values.
- Conditional tests and supported local successor edges, preserving return/throw termination.
- ORM field definitions, setters and hooks; generated persistence mapping when its adapter applies.
- Library-binding evidence, declared models/assumptions, relevant blockers and remaining coverage gaps.

The wire bundle stores each evidence record once and refers to it by an ID from source/transfer,
control and evidence-role records. Reports retain original spans and source hashes. Context selection
propagates simple input aliases and helper parameters; unrelated challenge bookkeeping is not a
continuation of the original string. This selection is not a full interprocedural solver.

Helper expansion is bounded to three levels and 24 definitions per traversal. A reached limit is
explicit and blocks a checked claim when required context might be missing. Requests remain bounded
by the adapter payload/response/deadline/request-count limits. No recursive autonomous model browsing
or repository upload is implemented. Comments and public challenge labels are untrusted benchmark
context, not expected-answer instructions; held-out original fixtures are required for accuracy work.

## Discovery on novel target repositories

The product must discover checks without prior knowledge of a target's challenge routes. Current
`--strings` already discovers supported SQL/outbound call shapes and route dependencies without a
requirements file; full claim-scoped automatic assessment is still incomplete. `--checks` files are
explicit business-policy inputs and evaluation selectors, not the intended prerequisite for scanning
a novel repository.

Deliver this next in the existing phases rather than adding target-specific vulnerability rules:

1. Phase 3: catalog source and sink argument roles, library provenance and semantics. Distinguish SQL
   text from bind values, outbound URL from body, and generated creation from an ordinary callback.
2. Phases 5–6: propagate field/value identities through helpers, aliases, mutations, guards, matched
   calls/returns and supported async continuations; preserve bypasses and unresolved behavior.
3. Phase 7: automatically assemble the same claim-scoped bundles used by checked mode. Include
   actual relevant function bodies, import/receiver provenance, schema/model constraints and blockers.
4. Phase 8: derive intrinsic questions from the sink model (for example, can input change SQL
   structure?). Keep explicit business requirements separate from inferred constraints. Label inferred
   requirements and their provenance; unknown business intent is not a demonstrated violation.
5. Phases 1/8/9: evaluate unseen vulnerable/protected/unknown repositories, independently review
   findings, and retain evidence/coverage in route-oriented JSON and SARIF.

Structural source/sink models remain necessary even when the judge recognizes arbitrary custom
validators. They establish what a value controls and what protection the operation requires; they do
not need a hard-coded regex for every adequate validator. The current bounded implementation cannot
yet guarantee detection of arbitrary novel repository flaws. See the
[original comparison corpus](../evaluation/corpus/README.md) for the current evaluation boundary.

## Declared library models

These are bounded semantic assumptions, not evidence that dependencies are trustworthy or runtime
bindings cannot change. Unknown/custom middleware and unmodeled operations remain blockers.

| Model | Current use and limits |
|---|---|
| ESM and Express receiver/registration subset | Direct registrations, named/namespace imports and direct/concise factories; required mount/path cases are explicit |
| Generic parser/header/logging/static middleware | Known imported transport/parser packages supply context without being treated as domain-field validators; custom middleware bodies are supplied separately |
| Sequelize raw query | Constructor/import provenance is supplied as source evidence identifying the modeled API; SQL text and parameter options have distinct roles; mutable/dynamic binding is not universally resolved |
| finale-rest generated resources | Supported direct resource declaration or literal table/for-loop/template expansion associates create endpoints with an imported model; arbitrary route generation is unsupported |

Model declarations are independent of validator adequacy. Exact package version compatibility,
custom extensions, setter effects and runtime behavior still need validation. Upstream references:
[Sequelize raw queries](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/raw-queries/) and
[finale resource semantics](https://github.com/tommybananas/finale/blob/master/README.md).

## Claim-specific completeness and outcomes

Required evidence roles are checked before a candidate becomes eligible for a scoped finding.
Missing route/helper/operation/model facts and unknown applicable guards block their affected claims.
Unrelated metadata, password-only transformations in an email SQL claim, or post-request response
coverage do not automatically block an independent earlier use. Gaps remain visible even when they
do not block a particular claim. Unclassified legacy candidates retain conservative uncertainty.

A missing guard body is not made irrelevant just because the judge says insufficient. An unknown
validator that receives the checked field remains a blocker. An unrelated helper must be excluded
by dependency/context selection, not by a target-specific exception. Tests cover both directions.

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `supported_potential` | Model finds insufficient protection; required evidence roles exist and no declared claim blocker remains, under the stated models/scope |
| `protected_for_claim` | Model finds sufficient protection for this exact stated constraint and supplied scope |
| `needs_evidence` | A relevant fact/role is missing, a limit was hit, or the model is uncertain |
| `not_applicable` | The declared protection question does not apply; not a general safety conclusion |
| Assessment failed / not_run | No completed semantic judgment; never a safe or confirmed finding |

These statuses are advisory source-analysis findings, not runtime-confirmed exploitability, formal
proof, or completed independent Findings Review. Positive findings need a supported violating case;
adequate-protection claims need the relevant paths/invariant. Future precision work must verify
coverage of mutation, aliases, middleware applicability, asynchronous effects and library extensions.

## Two phase acceptance cases

**Login email and SQL:** keep email type/format separate from SQL query semantics. The email
operand's parameter separation is the primary injection question; hashing a different operand or
accepting a syntactically valid email cannot establish it. The desired remediation set includes
parameterized SQL, server-side field constraints and negative/safe regression cases. Current SQL
call-shape checks are not universal SQL parsing or a complete driver/library resolver.

**Registration:** evaluate required email/password checks when passwordRepeat is absent, validation
before/after trimming, next()/return behavior, model validators, setters and hooks, and generated
creation. A challenge observer is not a rejecting validator or proof that a row was created. Detailed
source observations and test caveats live in the [registration case](../project/07-registration-validation-case.md).

Controlled fixtures must include vulnerable, protected and unknown variants. Test that model-irrelevant
gaps do not force uncertainty and that unknown guards still do. The source-path/role/golden tests
verify evidence assembly; fixed HTTP answers verify policy/transport, not model accuracy. Small
Luna-only calls on the pinned target are integration checks. Runtime confirmation additionally needs
an isolated application test and a persisted-row assertion; it has not been performed in this phase.

## Reporting and remediation

The [report design](reporting-and-sarif.md) keeps one route-oriented internal model and a SARIF export.
Report observed facts, model assessments, blockers, assumptions, reviewer status and runtime evidence
separately. Provide multiple complementary remediation options, with their required preconditions and
regression cases. Do not turn a generated suggestion into an applied fix or claim the route is immune.
