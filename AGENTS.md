# AGENTS.md — scan

## Start here

Agents MUST read this file and the [agent orientation](.zazz/docs/scan-agent-orientation.md)
at session start, then load only the context required for the task. Links are not automatic includes.
The [README](README.md) introduces the project; root [user documentation](docs/README.md) owns
philosophy, user setup, CLI usage, result interpretation, and contributor guides.
Product analysis rules and guidelines belong in root [docs/analysis](docs/analysis/README.md), not
`.zazz/`. Agents MUST load the matching analysis guide when changing scanner evidence or judgment.
Current assignments, progress, evaluation results, and session restrictions belong in the project
docs or local handoff, not this file. Agents MUST verify the actual worktree path, branch, and changes
before editing and MUST preserve unrelated user changes.

## Load context by task

| Task | Load |
|---|---|
| Run scan or configure a decision provider | [README](README.md), then [decision-model user guide](docs/decision-models.md) when needed |
| Product, scope, or architecture decisions | Orientation's [documentation map](.zazz/docs/scan-agent-orientation.md#documentation-map); select the document that owns the topic |
| Graph structure or outbound service paths | [Repository graph design](.zazz/architecture/repository-graph.md), then relevant architecture sections |
| Author or refine a spec | Relevant [plan](.zazz/project/implementation-plan.md) and contract, `spec-builder`, and [spec hygiene](.zazz/standards/spec-hygiene.md) |
| Implement, test, resume, or verify work | Assigned contract and local run log, [execution discipline](.zazz/docs/agent-execution-discipline.md), `spec-driven`, and matched [standards](.zazz/standards/index.yaml) |
| Create or manage a worktree | [Worktree setup](.zazz/docs/worktree-setup.md); [Worktrunk cheat sheet](.zazz/docs/wt-cheat-sheet.md) only when using Worktrunk |
| Refine SDLC or ownership/process rules | [Zazz methodology](.zazz/docs/zazz-methodology.md) |
| Edit documentation or standards | Matched [standards](.zazz/standards/index.yaml) and `doc-check` |
| Prepare or review a PR | [PR process](.zazz/standards/pr-process.md) and matching `pr-builder`/`pr-review` skill; [human-review guide](.zazz/docs/human-in-loop-pr-review-strategy.md) only for review policy |

Skills live in `.agents/skills/`; agents MUST load only the matching skill. Procedures belong in their
owning guides so this entry point stays small and stable.

## Authorization and delivery

An explicit user request to implement authorizes the requested work in the assigned isolated feature
worktree. Agents MUST NOT require a separate Deliverable Owner ceremony or repeated confirmation.
Agents MUST record bounded implementation scope and acceptance evidence in a tracked implementation
contract and refine it as the user steers the work. A backlog entry alone is not an implementation request.
The human user owns scope and review decisions; this is the meaning of Deliverable Owner in older guides.

Agents MUST use the assigned worktree for related architecture, documentation, implementation, and tests.
Independent future deliverables MAY be split when useful; agents MUST NOT create extra worktrees or PRs
merely for steps of the active task. These authorization rules take precedence over stricter
greenlight/topology wording in the methodology, execution discipline, and skills.

## Branch model

`stage` integrates reviewed work; `main` receives human-operated release promotion and version tags.
All fixes flow through `stage`. Agents MUST NOT merge PRs, merge locally into integration, tag releases,
or push directly to integration. Only explicitly assigned concept, architecture, or methodology
documentation may be edited in `stage/`; this does not permit spec work or feature implementation there.
Detailed layout and operations live in [worktree setup](.zazz/docs/worktree-setup.md).

Before committing or pushing, agents MUST verify path/branch, `git config user.name` (**zazzcode**),
and the zazzcode Git/`gh` authentication profile. Feature/deliverable PRs MUST start as drafts and target `stage`.

## Document model

**Internal DOCS_ROOT: `.zazz/`**. User-facing documentation belongs in root `docs/`. Specs are Git-tracked in `.zazz/specifications/`; execution scratch belongs in
gitignored `.zazz/ephemeral/` and MUST NOT be committed. Zazz Board is not used. See the
[documentation map](.zazz/docs/scan-agent-orientation.md#documentation-map) for durable document owners.

## Credentials and live model calls

Agents MUST NOT print `.env` contents or credentials, include secrets in tracked files, or pass keys
in command arguments. Agents MUST pass only the selected provider's key to the scanner child process.
Offline checks need no key. An existing local key is configuration, not authorization for paid calls.
Agents MUST follow the user's active provider/model restrictions, keep live request counts small and
explicit, and MUST NOT use automatic provider/model fallback. Funding context is not authorization to
exhaust a balance. Alternative adapters MAY be tested with local HTTP stubs.

## Verification

Agents MUST run the assigned contract's scoped checks using the worktree's declared Go toolchain.
The [contributor guide](docs/contributing.md) owns build, test, vet, and format commands;
[evidence conventions](.zazz/standards/testing.md) define the required validation record.
Agents MUST format only changed Go files and keep documentation changes within the requested scope.
