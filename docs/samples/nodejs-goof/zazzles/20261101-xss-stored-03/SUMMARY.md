# Stored rendering increment

2026-11-01; offline, no live model calls. Open [HTML](findings.html), [JSON](findings.json),
or [SARIF](findings.sarif); [metadata](metadata.json) records exact source hashes.

Goof login remains a finding. Todo Markdown rendering now has a stored-XSS finding with
request-to-Todo.content write/read evidence and the marked 0.3.5 sanitizer-bypass contract.
The direct update path is established; the create helper retains unknown-transform evidence.
The edit template protects todo content in text and quoted attributes. Identifier URL slots and
unresolved rendering origins remain Review.
