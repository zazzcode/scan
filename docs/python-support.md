Zazzles analyzes a bounded Python subset through the same evidence, decision and reporting pipeline
as JavaScript/TypeScript. It reads source; it does not run the application, install its dependencies,
open its database, or make the outbound requests found in the code.

```sh
go build -o bin/scan ./cmd/scan
./bin/scan --routes --json /path/to/python-app
./bin/scan --strings --entry server/routes.py --output-dir /path/to/findings /path/to/python-app
```

Omit `--entry` to discover all supported registration files, including mixed JS/TS/Python repositories.
The output directory receives `<app>/run-<id>/findings.json`, `findings.html` and `findings.sarif`.
Optional [decision assessment](decision-models.md) transmits bounded evidence only when requested.
Structural findings remain useful without a model; neither mode certifies an application as safe.

| Area | Implemented subset |
| --- | --- |
| Entries | Verified Flask app/Blueprint decorators, a single static Blueprint mount, RESTX Api/namespace Resource methods, FastAPI decorators |
| Sources | Flask args/form/values/JSON/cookies/headers/session, RESTX payload, FastAPI parameters; HTTP response text is a separate source |
| Flow | Assignments/reassignments, f-strings, percent/format/concatenation, output alternatives, bounded direct helpers and local imports; explicit request-method guards exclude impossible method branches |
| SQL | sqlite3 connection/cursor provenance, SQL text versus parameter tuple/list, statement construction and separate validation evidence |
| Validation | Policy-backed standalone field judgments and SQL facets; actual handler/helper guards and matching forms' field requirements are evidence. A browser constraint is not server enforcement. Missing policy stays uncertain. |
| Logging | Unshadowed print/logging bindings, credential/personal field hints, HTTP credentials, literal email and verified database-result candidates; length/presence/comparison controls |
| XSS | Flask HTML string returns, render_template/render_template_string, Jinja template variables and source construction, safe/Markup/escape/forceescape, autoescape blocks, explicit FastAPI HTML, bounded sqlite table/field stored-origin links |
| Browser XSS | Literal inline scripts in resolved templates reuse the browser adapter. Canonical versioned code.jquery.com script tags establish bounded jQuery bindings; input val() → append()/html() and nested callbacks are modeled. Native DOM append(string) is text. |
| Outbound | Request-influenced URL slots for requests/httpx functions and urllib.request.urlopen; method/body/response slots stay separate |

SQL construction is a practice finding independently of an injection judgment. Bound parameters
protect their data slots, not interpolated identifiers. Input-validation policy, injection protection,
HTML context and sensitive-data classification remain distinct questions.

Default Flask/Jinja escaping is trusted only in HTML text and quoted non-active attributes with a
verified binding and supported configuration. Script, URL, style, custom filters/options and unresolved
origins stay Review. Markup and safe mark text as trusted; applying escape to a trusted value does
not necessarily escape it. Forceescape and an already-escaped value are distinct controls.

Stored links use supported literal sqlite table/column writes and reads, retaining writing entries,
source hashes and transfer evidence. They are potential field flows, not proof that a particular row
was written or a deployed database matches the source. Row identity, migrations, arbitrary SELECT
projections/joins, ORM dispatch and mutation remain limitations. Unlinked origins remain Review.

Helper expansion is bounded to depth 3 and 24 calls per route, source files to 2 MiB, dependency paths
to 64 and transfers to 48. Loops, comprehensions, custom decorators, dynamic mounts, arbitrary
exceptions/heap aliases, template inheritance/macros and library extensions are incomplete. Reached
bounds and unresolved pre-use calls remain visible and cannot establish protection. Source-only
exception paths carry explicit preconditions; runtime feasibility still needs separate confirmation.

Python NoSQL extraction is not implemented: none of the three pinned Python apps uses PyMongo or
another MongoDB API. Existing JS/TS NoSQL support remains unchanged. SCA and new vulnerability families
are separate work. See the [Python evaluation](../.zazz/evaluation/python-support-results.md) for actual
sample coverage, comparator observations and remaining gaps.

Library contracts: [Flask templates](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templating/),
[sqlite3 parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute),
[FastAPI HTML responses](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#html-response),
[MarkupSafe escaping](https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/escaping/).

The shared [trace judgment design](../.zazz/architecture/trace-judgment.md) documents evidence
roles, trace/control edges, exact named-field policies, model consistency gates and reporting.
Verified Psycopg 2/3, PyMySQL and MySQL Connector cursor bindings now use driver-specific
parameter contracts. SQLite storage correlation remains SQLite-only. Request aliases and
relative package imports are bounded; variadic helper binding stays explicit uncertainty.
Constant Jinja templates require autoescaping for substituted HTML variables; `.render()` alone
does not establish XSS protection. Reports provide source-specific preservation, repair or
investigation guidance according to the final claim status. Only Protected is green.
