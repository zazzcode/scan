# Required decision-model assessment

## Core security judgment

Decision-model assessment is required and core to Zazzles' security-assessment workflow. The scanner
builds source-backed traces and operation/guard evidence for the model to judge. We develop and test
with the OpenAI Decisions API using Luna (`gpt-6-luna`). Jev and other models are planned for future
support. Model answers cannot replace missing source facts or override claim blockers.

Inventory, evidence extraction, deterministic practice checks, saved-report rendering and local tests
can run without an API key. Those are useful inspection/development modes; they do not complete the
model-assessed security workflow. Assessment completion remains separate from independent review
and runtime confirmation.

## Credentials and local environment

Configure Luna for the current assessed-scan workflow:

| Scanner provider | Environment variable | Selection |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Decisions | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `--judge openai --judge-model gpt-6-luna` |

Obtain a key through the selected provider's account/console. Keep it in a password manager or local
ignored `.env`, never chat, tracked files, logs, or command arguments. The tracked
[.env.sample](../.env.sample) has empty credential fields. Preserve an existing `.env` rather than
replacing it. See [environment loading](getting-started.md#local-environment-file): zazzles reads process
environment variables and does not automatically load the file.

A funded API account/key is separate from source-transmission permission and the zazzles's request cap.
The scanner has no currency-budget enforcement; choose an explicit small limit. There is no automatic
provider/model fallback. Agents must also obey the user's active provider/model restrictions.

## Scope a live run

Confirm the target root, entry file, selected route, and allowed source evidence before running:

```bash
(
  set -a
  . ./.env
  set +a
  ./bin/scan --analyze --json --entry server.ts \
    --route /rest/user/login --judge openai --judge-model gpt-6-luna \
    --judge-limit 1 /path/to/app
)
```

This sends bounded source evidence to the selected provider. The cap is per run; there are no retries.
Additional uses beyond the cap remain unassessed and cause exit 1. A requested assessment failure,
oversized payload, or exhausted cap is retained in the report; a setup failure before scanning can
produce no report. Optional `--checks` files specify business and protection requirements; they are
not expected model answers.

## Read outcomes separately

Model choices include sufficient, insufficient, uncertain, and not applicable for the named question.
The raw answers, execution state, and evidence completeness are retained. A supported potential
vulnerability alone remains Review in current presentation. Existing deterministic poor-practice
findings do not disappear because the model was not run or could not establish exploitability.

For authentication/permissions, verify the selected account and key locally without printing it.
For quota/rate failures, inspect that provider's account limits. For an exit-1 JSON report, read the
assessment reason rather than treating it as an empty or protected scan. Saved HTML/SARIF exports
need neither credentials nor another model call.

## Model-bound source and request size

The model receives source-backed trace, operand, guard and invocation evidence, not application
README files or exercise answer keys. Parsed code comments and Python docstrings are masked at their
original positions in the model-facing projection; executable code, runtime strings and relevant
template content remain. Canonical local reports retain original source text and snapshot hashes.
This reduces instruction-like training prose without deleting runtime behavior.

The request builder shares overlapping source excerpts while preserving every evidence role, original
span, snapshot hash and trace/control reference. Requests that would exceed the existing 64 KiB bound
use an explicit compact column schema and shared source/gap records. This is lossless representation
compaction; it does not remove blockers or make missing coverage complete. A request that still
exceeds the bound remains unassessed. Changed projection/envelope inputs invalidate exact replay;
raw historical responses remain intact.

## Component provenance

SQL, NoSQL, standalone-validation and XSS requests compose scanner-owned interpretation material selected
by the static analyzer from verified source facts. Fresh schema-4 JSON reports identify the selected
pack/components, versions and digests; a selection alone does not mean a model assessment ran. SQL
uses `sql-components-v2`, NoSQL `nosql-components-v1` and standalone validation
`validation-components-v1`; XSS uses `xss-components-v1`. Unmigrated families retain their existing protocols. Mandatory evidence
and consistency gates remain in Go.

Missing required material, conflicting selection or size limits prevent a model request and retain
an explicit unresolved assessment. No generic guidance fallback supplies missing protection.
Exact-request replay binds selected content/provenance as well as evidence, questions and model.
Changed requests need fresh assessment; exporting an older report preserves its historical answers
and does not assign it new component identities. See the
[technical approach](technical-approach.md#analysis-knowledge-and-components).


## Outbound observations

Outbound observations have no implemented security assessment. Assessing one returns `not_run` with
an explicit reason, no question version or request digest and zero model HTTP calls. Preview returns
a non-assessable error without a request body. SQL validation/construction questions cannot establish
destination security. Static `analysis_components` metadata describes observation scope only.

A requested scan with an unassessed outbound observation remains incomplete and exits 1 while saving
its Review record. The conservative request-limit schedule still counts candidate positions, including
observations; it does not promise that every unused HTTP slot will be reassigned. Supported families
continue under the same cap. Structural-only scans do not request model completion. Saved historical
generic answers, versions and statuses remain intact on export; they are not rewritten or replayed
onto new evidence. Full SSRF, exfiltration and browser-security assessment require separate contracts.
