## CI/CD artifacts

Set `SCAN_FINDINGS_DIR` to a runner-local output root or pass `--output-dir`. Run offline unless model
assessment is deliberately configured with the CI platform's secret store. A requested model failure
still writes the available report bundle and exits 1; an earlier setup/parse failure may produce no
bundle. Upload artifacts even after a failed scan. This example assumes the scanner binary has been
built and the target is checked out at `target/` with its entry file at `server.ts`:

```yaml
- name: Scan target
  env:
    SCAN_FINDINGS_DIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/scan-findings
  run: ./bin/scan --analyze --entry server.ts target

- name: Save scan reports
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
  with:
    name: scan-findings-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
    path: ${{ runner.temp }}/scan-findings/
    if-no-files-found: warn
    retention-days: 7
```

Download the artifact to open the HTML locally and retain JSON for agent analysis. Uploading an
artifact does not automatically import SARIF into a code-scanning service; use that service's SARIF
ingestion step separately when enabled. Review artifact access/retention because reports contain
source excerpts. Detection does not currently fail CI on finding severity; exit codes describe
execution and requested-assessment completion. See GitHub's
[artifact guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/store-and-share-data) and
[upload action](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) for supported runner/edition requirements.
